The constant heating and cooling of the exhaust manifold can cause leaks. You may catch a small crack before it becomes large enough to make a noise and become a more serious problem.,"1) Secure the vehicle on a level surface, making sure the vehicle will not roll or lean when jacked up. 2) Using a jack, lift up the vehicle. Every vehicle comes from the factory with a jack. To locate and properly use this jack see the owners manual. The owners manual will inform you what proper jacking locations should be used. 3) Secure the vehicle with jack stands on both sides for safety before starting any work. The pinch welds or the frame rails are the two best locations. Do not rely on the jack alone to hold the vehicle up while working. 4) Locate the front exhaust pipe, it is the first length of pipefrom the engine.Sometimesthis is thelength of pipe before the catalytic converter.On other manufacturers this is the intermediary pipe which is between the catalytic converter and the muffler. Check the pipe for corrosion holes, and damage.']"
The Exhaust manifold carries the compusted gases from the engine to the exhaust. The exhuast manifold becomes extremely hot because of engine combustion. The constant heating and cooling of the exhaust manifold can cause it to crack or wear the gasket down over time causing it to leak.," 1) Open the hood and locate the exhaust manifold. The exhaust manifold connects the cylinder head to the exhaust pipe. The exhaust manifolds can become extremely hot, this test you will be getting close to them make sure to wear protective gloves and be aware and don't get to close to the manifolds or any other moving parts of the engine.  2) To inspect the exhaust manifold you will need either a technicians stethoscope, commonly sold at parts stores, or a lengthy piece of tubing you can use as a listening aid. With the vehicle running, us the hearing device put the tube or tool near the exhaust manifold and listen through the other end, you will easily notice the difference in sound when you locate the leak it will sound like a rush of gas spitting from the leak.']"

If your system has multiple sections that are rusted, cracked, or causing exhaust leaks, it is recommended that you install a new exhaust system into your vehicle.']"
A heater core is a small  scaled down version of the radiator in the front of your vehicle. The heater core is located inside your vehicle in the dash on the passenger side inside of the blower case. They can wear down over time from heat expansion and corrosion. If your windows are fogging up when you put on the defroster there is a good chance the heater core is to blame. A small leak in the heater core will give off a steam that can cause your windows to fog and is usually accompanied with a sweet coolant /antifreeze smell.,"1) Open the hood locate and remove the radiator cap 2) Connect the pressure tester to the radiatorfiller.Pumping the pressure tester raise the pressure to theratingthat ison the radiator cap. 3) Watch the gauge on the pressure tester it should be able to hold the pressure for 12-15 minutes, if the gauge starts to fall immediately there is a system leak. Visually inspect the vehicle for coolant leaks. Check the radiator, water pump, coolant tank, radiator hoses, and check under the vehicle for drips that you can follow back to the location of the leak. Also check inside the vehicle, the heater core is located inside the dash on the passengers side, check the front passenger floor for dampness, also look under passenger side dash for any signs of a coolant leak.']"
"The Radiator will leak after normal wear; however, failure may result if coolant is left unserviced, collision damage, or having the vehicle overheat. To prolong the life of the radiator, perform periodic maintenace on the coolant system.","1) Open the hood and locate the radiator. The radiator is commonly found and mounted to the front of the engine compartment behind the front grille. Depending on the vehicle, a cap is visible on the top of the radiator assembly on either the left or right side. 2) After locating the radiator, locate the radiator cap. Open the radiator cap, be sure the vehicle is cold before opening the cap to avoid personal injury. 3) Use a radiator pressure tester tool, and install the tool over the radiator cap opening. Use the tool to test the radiator pressure. If the readings indicate a low/dropping reading, replace the radiator. 4) Check the radiator cap, and inspect for proper pressure. If the cap fails the pressure test, replace the radiator cap. 5) Inspect the radiator and check for leaks during pressure testing. 6) If the radiator checks fine, proceed to inspect the engine block and the radiator hoses, coolant hoses and all areas of the cooling system. These areas include the coolant reservoir, heater core hoses, water pump and thermostat.']"
"Loose or worn suspension components will affect vehicle handling and wheel alignment. Loose wheel bearings and worn bushings can cause virbrations, pulling, and increased tire wear.","1) Openthe hood and locate the top ofthesuspension strut mounts/shock towers. 2) Before starting any repairs, besure the vehicle is in park.Have an assistant push down on the fender to simulate driving over bumps. 3) Locate and Inspect the upper shock mounts on the inside of the engine compartment and underneath the wheel well for damage. 4) Closethe hood, then securethe vehicle on a level surface, making sure it will not roll or lean when jacked up. 5) Inspect the vehicle ride height (coil springs, struts, or torsion bars). Some owners manuals will have ride height specifications. The left and right side measurements should be equal. 6) Using a floor jack, lift the front ofthe vehicle. 7) Secure the vehicle with jack stands on both sides for safety before starting any work. The pinch welds or the frame rails are the two best locations. Do not rely on the jack to hold the vehicle. 8) Inspect all suspension grease boots for damage and make sure the boots are full of grease. 9) Use a grease gun and apply grease through the zerk fitting (grease fitting). When the grease begins to ooze from the joint, the boot is full. 10) Inspect sway bar mounts and end linkage for loose, bent, or missing components. Any damaged linkage will need to be replaced. 11) Inspect the control arms for damage to the bushings and ball joints. Bushing kits and ball joints are available for replacement; however, replacing the control arm assembly may also bean option. 12) Inspect the steering rack, steering box, steering column, and the inner tie rod linkage. 13) Inspect the outer tie rod ends for excessive play at the connection to the steering knuckle. You will also want to inspect the tie rod boots for damage.Note: On some vehicles, it may be necessary to remove the wheels to see and inspect the outer tie rod end. 14) Replace the necessary suspension system components and take the vehicle to a certified technician for proper alignment. 15) Test drive the vehicle and verify if there is suspension noise.']"
"The most common causes of a wheel becoming bent is running into a large object, hitting a curb, or running over a large pot hole at a fast speed.","1) Secure the vehicle on a level surface, making sure the vehicle will not roll or lean too much when jacked up. 2) Using a floor jack, lift up the vehicle. 3) Secure the vehicle with a jack stand for safety before starting any work. The pinch welds or the frame rails are the two best locations. Do not rely on the jack alone to hold the vehicle up while working. 4) Visually inspect the wheel for damage,spin the wheel to check if there is any wobble know as lateral run out the tire should spin smoothly. Hold a straight edge tool parallel to the tire to help you notice if there is any bend in the wheel. The vehicle may need to be in nuetral depending on which wheel you are checking, if the wheel is not spining freely you will want to put the vehicle in nuetral, make sure you use chop blocks to keep the vehicle from sliding.']"
"Wheel balance can affect the ride of your vehicle, if the wheels are out of balance you may be experiencing a vibration feeling or vibration noise when driving, and sometimes its even stronger at highway speeds. Wheel balancing is done to compensate for heavy spots of  the wheel and tire, if your wheels are bent or chipped this can cause your wheel to be out of balance. Wheel weights are adhered or clipped to the wheel rim to compensate for these differences. Irregular tire wear is also a symptom of a wheel not being balanced.","1) Secure the vehicle on a level surface, making sure the vehicle will not roll or lean when jacked up.', ""2) Use a floor jack to lift the vehicle. Most vehicles are equipped with a factory floor jack commonly located in the trunk. To properly use the floor jack consult your vehicle owner's manual. Following the owner's manual instructions will give the correct location to jack the vehicle up and the the proper operation of the jack.  3) Secure the vehicle with jack stands on both sides for added safety before starting any work. Do not rely on the floor jack tosupport the entire weight of the vehicle. 4) Now remove the lug nuts followed by the wheels. 5) After removing the wheel/tire from the vehicle, it will be necessary to take it to a certified automotive repair faciltiy to complete the tire/wheel balance inspection. Otherwise, if you have direct access to tire/wheel balancing equipment, follow the manufacturers instructions to complete the process. 6) Balancing the tire/wheel assemblyinvolves the precise placement of wheel weights on opposite sides of the inner or outer edge. The weights arespecifically designed for different rim/wheel applications. If performing this procedure on your own, pay close attention to the typeof wheel weights necessaryand make sure final readings reach optimum wheel/rim balance. 7) After the wheel/rim is balanced, check the rim/wheel for possible damage. In some cases, the wheel/rim may be bent or cracked beyond repair, causing the steering wheel to pulsate and experience rough road drivability. If this issue is present, it will be necessary to replace the entire rim/wheel assembly. 8) Also, check the tires for proper tread. Uneven tire tread wear is an indication that the problem may have to befurther diagnosed into the vehicle suspension. Tires can be just as responsible for uneven balance, if they look bald, have side wall damage or are under inflated.']"
"Engine mounts are subject to normal wear; however, excessive torque and movement between the engine block and frame can prematurely weaken them. If one engine mount is bad, it is common for the other to be worn. Replacing both at the same time is strongly recommended.","1) Start the engine and locate the engine mounts. 2) Have an assistant in the vehicle, apply the parking brake, press the brake pedal with your left foot, shift the transmission into gear and lightly apply pressure onto the gas pedal. 3) When torque is applied to the engine while in gear, visually inspect the engine mounts. Look for excessive movement in the engine mounts and listen for a knocking noise when engine torque is released. Engine mounts are designed to absorb vibration during normal engine operation.Worn engine mounts will allow the engine to shift excessively creating vibration and noise.']"
