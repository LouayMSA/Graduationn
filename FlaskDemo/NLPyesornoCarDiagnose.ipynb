Some owners manuals will have ride height specifications. The left and right side measurements should be equal. 6) Using a floor jack, lift the front ofthe vehicle. 7) Secure the vehicle with jack stands on both sides for safety before starting any work. The pinch welds or the frame rails are the two best locations. Do not rely on the jack to hold the vehicle. 8) Inspect all suspension grease boots for damage and make sure the boots are full of grease. 9) Use a grease gun and apply grease through the zerk fitting (grease fitting). When the grease begins to ooze from the joint, the boot is full. 10) Inspect sway bar mounts and end linkage for loose, bent, or missing components. Any damaged linkage will need to be replaced. 11) Inspect the control arms for damage to the bushings and ball joints. Bushing kits and ball joints are available for replacement; however, replacing the control arm assembly may also bean option. 12) Inspect the steering rack, steering box, steering column, and the inner tie rod linkage. 13) Inspect the outer tie rod ends for excessive play at the connection to the steering knuckle. You will also want to inspect the tie rod boots for damage.Note: On some vehicles, it may be necessary to remove the wheels to see and inspect the outer tie rod end. 14) Replace the necessary suspension system components and take the vehicle to a certified technician for proper alignment. 15) Test drive the vehicle and verify if there is suspension noise.']\"]\n"

Every vehicle comes from the factory with a jack. To locate and properly use this jack see the owners manual. The owners manual will inform you what proper jacking locations should be used. 3) Secure the vehicle with jack stands on both sides for safety before starting any work. The pinch welds or the frame rails are the two best locations to use. Do not rely on the jack to hold the vehicle up while working. 4) Inspect the entire exhaust system for damage. If your system has multiple sections that are rusted, cracked, or causing exhaust leaks, it is recommended that you install a new exhaust system into your vehicle.']\"]\n"
