When your serpentine belt begins to make noise or is noticebly worn or damaged, its time to replace it. A bad serpentine belt can cause your vehicle to stall, steering to tighten up, and even overheat your vehicle.']\n",

      "Inspection List:  [\"1) Open the vehicles hood and locate the vehicles serpentine belt. 2) Inspect the ribs onthe serpentine belt.Check for cracks in the rubber, fraying, or chips to the belt. Look forsigns offluids that may have spilled on the belt. 3) Check the belt tension by pushing down in the middle of a section of the belt. It should not move more than a half inch. Look at the smooth side of the belt if it looks glazed, like it has a shine to it, the belt is probably loose and slipping on the pulleys.']\"]\n"
